    'content': "<p>Entering into my first year of university, I knew I wanted to make the most of my experience. I was determined to figure out a way to balance my studies with extracurricular activities (as well as sleep, and social life, and sanity). At least, I would try my best! That's when I found out about the Innovation Hub, a student-led initiative launched to improve student experience through research. The I-Hub would allow me to get involved on campus, cater to my personal interests, and positively impact a diverse group of people-no matter the size! For these reasons, I jumped right in! I completed the application (there's CCR-credit, so win-win!). Now I'm here, writing a piece about my experience at September's weekend-long training.</p>" +

      "<p>Walking into a room of about a hundred people, without knowing anyone at all, was quite daunting at first. The training consisted of various activities which involved going up to someone, and spark up a conversation from nothing but the typical, day-to-day topics assigned beforehand (such as a day-in-the-life recap and your best/worst lunch stories to name a few) felt a bit awkward and forced.</p>" +

      "<img src='images/news_images/emerging_image.jpg' />" +

      "<p>Throughout the course of the training and right after, I reflected upon the purpose and value of these activities (i.e. interviews and observations). Then I realized that the Innovation Hub strives to foster and facilitate learning; we, as community members, can communicate with people in a open space, where they feel safe, valued, and comfortable enough to share their own stories. Everybody has one: a story worth listening to and worth telling. Through these stories, we can build something that can be invaluable to some aspect of their everyday student life.</p>" +

      "<p>As a first-time volunteer, I'm excited to put in the time and effort, knowing that I'm working closely with all sorts of different people who are committed to the same mission of bringing about significant change to the student body. And as a member of the Communications team, I look forward to promoting the Innovation Hub-who we are and what we do-within the University of Toronto and beyond.</p>" +

      "<h3>PAUL'S PERSPECTIVE</h3>" +

      "<p>The weekend started off bright and early, with breakfast, coffee, and some sleepy eyes. Faces were full of curiosity and intent from both Innovation Hub volunteers and staff. We soon got off to an exciting start with a full debrief of the tasks, research, and events we would take part in this year. Over the course of the two-days training, we had the chance to get to know our group and become familiar with everyone's strengths and weaknesses. Teams were also able to begin working on the first steps of their project plans. The training sessions were filled with interesting presentations, bonding, and great food.</p>" +

      "<p>I must admit, it was difficult to keep my eyes open (due to the early rise), at times; I also wished the room had a window or two. Nonetheless, I found the training genuinely interesting and stimulating. At first, I thought that the training would definitely benefit from a later start-time, and task/topic efficiency. However, when reflecting post-training, I realized that this year-as a volunteer for the Innovation Hub-is going to be packed with thought-provoking, engaging projects and activities.</p>"

    'content': "<p>I am absolutely thrilled to introduce our Fall/Winter 2018-2019 team! The Innovation Hub is made up of passionate, knowledgeable, and creatively engaging individuals-both new and returning. This diverse team of staff, work-study students, and volunteers embrace a hands-on, multidisciplinary approach.  I am deeply inspired by my fellow teammates, whose personal and academic experiences add both flavour and depth to the I-Hub's work! Together, we hail from various academic fields, degrees, and even regions of the globe!</p>" +

      "<p>During one of our introductory meetings, Claire (the I-Hub's Connector) and I prepared a brief activity for all team members. This activity involved both personal, written reflection and group discussion. Claire designed an infographic (see above), by applying team feedback to question four ('Describe the Innovation Hub, in 3-4 key words'). Interestingly, we noticed that 'collaborative' and 'human-centered' arose most often; this is telling of what the team understands and promotes as key in the I-Hub's success. This, in many respects, parallels my own impression of the Innovation Hub. Reflecting upon the I-Hub's unique approach, I highlight that its members (mainly students) strive to gain insight into the 'worlds' of University of Toronto students, staff, and faculty (human-centred). Such insight is achieved through a collection of participatory (collaborative) methods, such as interviewing and observation. At the Innovation Hub, we work with one another (team-based) and research participants (community-based) to help illuminate the realities of UofT experiences.</p>" +

    'title': 'Call for Project Submissions is Now Open at the Innovation Hub!',

    'date': 'August 9, 2018',

    'content': "<p>I joined the Innovation Hub a year ago because I care deeply about improving the student experience at UofT. As a second-year undergrad student, I've encountered first-hand the ups and downs of being enmeshed in an educational institution, especially one as vast as ours. The work of the Innovation Hub is important and exciting to me because it brings together individuals from all across the university to effect sustained change in students' lives-including my own.</p>" +

      "<p>The Innovation Hub delivers customized insights to partners in the university community who have a question, challenge or project that centres around their work with students. Our research draws from design thinking and ethnographic methodologies, and is conducted with students, by students. By bringing in student perspectives early on in the process, the Innovation Hub can help you design with (and not just for) students in order to better meet their needs.</p>" +

      "<p>To date, the Innovation Hub has collaborated with partners such as Academic + Campus Events, the Centre for International Experience, First Nations House and UofT's Trademark & Licensing Office. Now, we're excited to open up submissions to any UofT division, department or student organization looking to explore a question or challenge that reflects the themes of one of our five domains.</p>" +

      "<p>If you feel like your project could benefit from new insights into student perspectives, we invite you to review the proposal guidelines and submit your project idea. At no cost, we'll assemble a team of student experts to build on your existing resources and give you support by creating a research strategy, collecting and analyzing data, generating insights based on the data, providing design criteria based on the insights and working with your team to develop ideas and prototypes.</p>"
