    I am absolutely thrilled to introduce our Fall/Winter 2018-2019 team! The Innovation Hub is made up of passionate, knowledgeable, and creatively engaging individuals—both new and returning. This diverse team of staff, work-study students, and volunteers embrace a hands-on, multidisciplinary approach.  I am deeply inspired by my fellow teammates, whose personal and academic experiences add both flavour and depth to the I-Hub’s work! Together, we hail from various academic fields, degrees, and even regions of the globe!

    During one of our introductory meetings, Claire (the I-Hub’s Connector) and I prepared a brief activity for all team members. This activity involved both personal, written reflection and group discussion. Claire designed an infographic (see above), by applying team feedback to question four (‘Describe the Innovation Hub, in 3-4 key words’). Interestingly, we noticed that ‘collaborative’ and ‘human-centered’ arose most often; this is telling of what the team understands and promotes as key in the I-Hub’s success. This, in many respects, parallels my own impression of the Innovation Hub. Reflecting upon the I-Hub’s unique approach, I highlight that its members (mainly students) strive to gain insight into the ‘worlds’ of University of Toronto students, staff, and faculty (human-centred). Such insight is achieved through a collection of participatory (collaborative) methods, such as interviewing and observation. At the Innovation Hub, we work with one another (team-based) and research participants (community-based) to help illuminate the realities of UofT experiences.

    On September 29th and 30th, the I-Hub held a full weekend training for both staff and volunteers.  The weekend format allowed us to build a sense of connectedness, commitment, and collaborative dynamism early on.  This training also provided teams the opportunity to touch-base and begin constructing a formal project plan. An evocative research question launches each of these project plans:

    Through community-building and problem-solving, this year is sure to bring about more constructive,  energizing change to UofT students.

    I joined the Innovation Hub a year ago because I care deeply about improving the student experience at UofT. As a second-year undergrad student, I’ve encountered first-hand the ups and downs of being enmeshed in an educational institution, especially one as vast as ours. The work of the Innovation Hub is important and exciting to me because it brings together individuals from all across the university to effect sustained change in students’ lives—including my own.

    The Innovation Hub delivers customized insights to partners in the university community who have a question, challenge or project that centres around their work with students. Our research draws from design thinking and ethnographic methodologies, and is conducted with students, by students. By bringing in student perspectives early on in the process, the Innovation Hub can help you design with (and not just for) students in order to better meet their needs.

    To date, the Innovation Hub has collaborated with partners such as Academic + Campus Events, the Centre for International Experience, First Nations House and UofT’s Trademark & Licensing Office. Now, we’re excited to open up submissions to any UofT division, department or student organization looking to explore a question or challenge that reflects the themes of one of our five domains.

    If you feel like your project could benefit from new insights into student perspectives, we invite you to review the proposal guidelines and submit your project idea. At no cost, we’ll assemble a team of student experts to build on your existing resources and give you support by creating a research strategy, collecting and analyzing data, generating insights based on the data, providing design criteria based on the insights and working with your team to develop ideas and prototypes.
