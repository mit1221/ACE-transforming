    'content': "<p>A world-class institution deserves world-class spaces for learning and instruction. That's why we think that Academic and Campus Events (ACE) landmark renovation project - Transforming the Instructional Landscape (TIL) - will be such an exciting and impactful project at U of T. The instructional space on campus plays an essential role in fulfilling the university's mandate to provide an unparalleled learning experience and impacts every student here. As the steward of these important facilities, ACE is committed to developing accessible, innovative, and purpose-built classrooms that address the needs of instructors and students. We can't help but be inspired by their ambitious new vision for U of T.</p>" +
      "<p>To achieve this vision, ACE has partnered with us to take taking an innovative approach to the re-design of instructional space. Using human-centred methodologies, we seek to deeply understand the user experience to ensure that user needs, desires, and perspectives are at the core of the re-design process. With ACE's sights set to renovate 174 classrooms across 23 buildings on campus, we are working hard to gather data through observation, interviews and pop-up style events to test and get feedback on potential designs. Rather than a linear process, design thinking is an iterative process of prototyping and testing, continually engaging and drawing upon user experience. Through this process, ACE aims to embrace the idea of providing a better experience to every community member who uses academic spaces. Getting early and constant feedback makes the ideation process more efficient and assures the best fit with what stakeholders are looking for. Furthermore, it provides students and faculty a stake in the design process.</p>" +
      "<p>What additionally makes this project so impactful, is the unique role that ACE has in the postsecondary sector as a dedicated space management team for such a large percentage of campus space.  Few other universities consolidate classroom and shared space allocation across departments and buildings into one dedicated, multi-faceted team, allowing for more flexible and efficient processes. The traditional method of space allocation in academic institutions assigns rooms based on department and building, leaving rooms unused or poorly allocated in reference to instructional needs. By consolidating the space management of both classrooms and shared space under one umbrella, ACE is able to recognize and respond to the changing needs of students and instructors.  Classroom spaces are assigned based on efficiency and pedagogical considerations allowing for better support of instructors and students.  ACE's approach allows the instructional landscape to keep pace with evolving technologies and emerging teaching pedagogies.</p>" +
      "<p>With an eye to improving the learning experience in <strong>almost 6000 courses across campus</strong>, Transforming the Instructional Landscape is no small feat. Working in collaboration, not just with the Innovation Hub, but the very students and faculty that instruct and learn in these spaces is crucial to ensuring the most impactful re-design possible. And engaging in the ongoing iterative process of prototyping and refining designs ensures that ACE will be well positioned to effectively maintain transformative spaces on campus for many years to come.

      "<img src='images/news_images/12-11-2018_A.jpg' />" +
      "<p>Classroom furnishings play a major role in facilitating discussion. Furniture arrangements that allow for eye contact, audibility, and mobility (to accommodate both accessibility needs and the parameters of a given assignment) were favoured by students. Rooms with shared tables, as opposed to individual desks, create “natural” discussion and project groups and eliminate some of the awkwardness of chatting with classmates. Rather than warily eyeing their belongings stowed along the wall or at the front of the class, adequate space around seating arrangements to store bags and coats lets students keep both eyes on the board.</p>" +
      "<p>Comfort is key. It is difficult to focus on lecture content when you’re seated in hot and stuffy or cold and draft-filled rooms. Many classrooms experience large swings in temperature as the seasons change. Rooms with spotty lighting can lull students to sleep, while the eye strain and glare from excessively bright bulbs can make following work on the blackboard a real chore. Natural lighting from windows-especially those offering a view of campus greenspace-creates an inviting and relaxing atmosphere.</p>" +
      "<p>Many students felt that working in the University of Toronto’s iconic buildings was a quintessential part of their university experience. They had fond memories that were tied, directly, to these spaces. While climate control can be an issue, students want to spend more time in and around these historic buildings.</p>" +
      "<img src='images/news_images/12-11-2018_B.jpg'/>" +
      "<p>On the other side of the classroom, instructors face their own unique set of challenges. Instructors looking to engage students directly in discussion were frustrated when assigned to a room of fixed seats in rows facing the front. In contrast, those conducting more traditional lectures found students seated around circular tables craning their necks in order to face them. Rather than design rooms that cater to every need at once, matching instructors with the room that best suits their teaching style can yield immediate improvements.</p>" +
      "<p>As of September 2018, the scope of the Innovation Hub’s involvement in TIL has greatly expanded into a full partnership. Our research&nbsp;team is engaging students and instructors in long form interviews, observing classes in progress, and collecting feedback through TIL’s <a href='https://www.ace.utoronto.ca/til/'>new website</a></p>" +
      "<p>Classroom design is an ongoing, collaborative process: we want you to be a part of it. ACE and the Innovation Hub are organizing a series of events where you can voice their opinions and share your experiences with our researchers. Watch this space for more information as TIL continues to expand!</p>"

"<p>At the <u>Pre-Conference Workshop Learning Space Design Jam</u> facilitated by Adam Finkelstein (McGill), we feedback on each participants learning space designs to explore how design thinking can enhance the learning space design process. We learned from each other’s experience at updating classroom to better Teaching & Learning experience. Common concerns shared across Institutions were: Faculty Engagement, Ownership of classrooms, Budget and Funding, Policy, technological evolution.</p>"

"<p>John Augeri from Paris Digital University presented <u>The Rise of Informal Learning Spaces: Design, Challenges, Assessment</u>.  This topic resonates to our hearts as ACE has been long campaigning to bring good design into not just classrooms (formal learning spaces), but also to the informal spaces around it.  We understand learning is not limited in just within the walls of classrooms, students need quality space outside of classrooms for peer learning to exchange ideas and spark creativities. </p>"+

In fact, over the past two weeks, the TIL team has run a series of events to ask students and faculty, “what makes a classroom great?”  From movable furniture to screen-sharing capabilities for students, newly created classrooms on campus enable a shift in both how students think about learning and how faculty think about teaching.</p>"
 +"<img src='images/news_images/181211 ACE-Furniture-Fair-06-768x512.jpg'/>"+
"<p>So far in the research process for the <u><a href='https://www.ace.utoronto.ca/til/'>TIL project</a></u> we have hit some impressive numbers. With <strong>174 classrooms</strong> up for renovation. there is a tremendous opportunity to change the pedagogical landscape at U of T and transform not just the learning experience for students, but also the social experience of attending a large institution like U of T. With a move toward more collaborative work, group seating and active learning spaces, new classrooms on campus will provide opportunities for academic and student community development.</p>"
+
"<p>One such space that showcases a new classroom style is Lee & Margaret Lau Auditorium in the Myhal Centre for Engineering Innovation and Entrepreneurship. With <strong>468 seats</strong> set in small groups, microphones for sharing ideas, and a <strong>60-foot video wall</strong>, this feat of design and technology is an impressive new space that instructors are eager to try out for their large classes. Over <strong>40 faculty, teaching support staff and AV specialists</strong> came out on November 27th to our event Myhal 150: Bring Us Your Vision, Make It a Reality. Keen to learn about the new technological capabilities of this room, and to provide feedback on teaching experience thus far, many faculty shared their teaching visions with the <u><a href='https://www.ace.utoronto.ca/til/'>TIL</a></u> team.</p>"
+
"<p>One such vision includes combined lecture/tutorial sections. Lectures could be interspersed with activities completed at each desk cluster and monitored by the instructor from the teaching station. Another emphasized resource sharing: students can actively contribute quotation, articles, and video clips mid lecture, which the instructor can seamlessly integrate into the flow of the class. These examples illustrate the collaborative nature of Myhal 150. Thanks to advances in technology and a greater understanding of the relationship between classroom space and pedagogy, university classes are no longer limited to the unidirectional flow of information from instructor to student.</p>"
+"<img src='images/news_images/181211 ACE-Furniture-Fair-18-768x512.jpg'/>" + 
"<p>In addition to faculty engagement in our research, the recent furniture events hosted by <u><a href='https://ace.utoronto.ca/'>ACE</a></u> brought us feedback from <strong>over 700 students</strong> on the furniture they prefer, their favourite classrooms on campus, and challenges they encounter in classes both large and small. Themes from these conversations highlighted student needs for accessible seating and ample storage space for belongings, among many others.</p>"
+ 
"<p>The next big phase of the <u><a href='https://www.ace.utoronto.ca/til/'>TIL</a></u> project is to engage in data analysis to uncover the core needs of classrooms users such that we can find innovative ways to bring it all together into classroom re-design.
